** TODO [3/3] [100%] Revise for algorithmics
*** [X] Complexity
*** [X] ADTs
*** [2/2] Trees
 - [X] BST
   - [X] Balancing
   - [X] AVL
     left and right differ by at most 1, subtrees are also AVL trees
     Balance factors:
     + -1: right subtree deeper
     + 0 : equal
     + +1: left subtree deeper
   - [X] Red-Black
     + child of a red node must be black
     + number of black nodes must be the same in all paths from root to leaves
       or nodes with a single child
       + Insertion:
         + add new
           + if root -> black else red
           + if parent is red
             + relabel or rotate
               + relabel if 'uncle' exists and is also red
               + rotate if 'uncle' not found or is black
 - [X] Heaps!
   + root at 0
   + last at size()-1
   + parent of k is floor((k-1)/2)
   + children of k are 2k+1 and 2k+2
*** [X] Hashes
+ address = hash code % table size
+ chain collisions (separate chaining)
+ linear probing:
  + clash -> place in next spot
  + primary clustering is an issue
+ Quadratic probing
  + jump forward in squares
  + 1,4,9,16 steps
  + unlucky -> unable to add even though table isn't full
    + prime size -> (<half full -> always a free position)
+ Double Hashing
  + place at h(x) + i*h2(x) where
    + i is number of failures
    + h2 is a second hashing function
      + e.g. h2(x) = R - (x%R) where R is prime < size
  + needs prime table size so h2(x) is not factor of size
+ Lazy remove for probe hashes - add placeholder to fix empty spot
+ normally use chaining
** TODO [3/5] Software Modelling and Design Coursework
